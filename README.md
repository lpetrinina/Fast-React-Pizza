- ✅ Cart - displaying all added pizzas, the quantity of which can be changed;
  
- ✅ Order - the user has to fill out the form and complete the order;
    * The username field is pre-filled, but it can be changed.
    * The address field can be filled in manually or automatically, but this requires the user to accept that the browser has access to their location.
